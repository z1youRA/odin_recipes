        <p>Spicy chicken with peanuts, similar to what is served in Chinese restaurants. It is easy to make, 
            and you can be as sloppy with the measurements as you want. They reduce to a nice, thick sauce. 
            Substitute cashews for peanuts, or bamboo shoots for the water chestnuts. You can't go wrong! Enjoy!</p>

                To Make Sauce: In a small bowl combine 1 tablespoon wine, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon oil, 1 tablespoon cornstarch/water mixture, chili paste, vinegar and sugar. Mix together and add green onion, garlic, water chestnuts and peanuts. In a medium skillet, heat sauce slowly until aromatic.
