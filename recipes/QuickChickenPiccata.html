        <p>These quick and easy pan-fried chicken breasts are topped with a simple pan sauce made with capers, butter, white wine, and lemon juice.</p>
        <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
            </li>
            <li>
                cayenne pepper, or to taste
            </li>
            <li>
                salt and ground black pepper to taste
            </li>
            <li>
                all-purpose flour for dredging
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place chicken breasts between 2 layers of plastic wrap and pound to about 1/2-inch thick.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the pan, reduce heat to medium, and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side; remove to a plate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook capers in reserved oil, smashing them lightly to release brine, until warmed though, about 30 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour white wine into skillet. Scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir lemon juice, water, and butter into the reduced wine mixture; cook and stir continuously to form a thick sauce, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir parsley through the sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                Return chicken breasts to the pan cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve with sauce spooned over the top.
            </li>
        </ol>
