        <ul>
            <li>
                2 cups all-purpose flour
            </li>
            <li>
                1 teaspoon baking soda
            </li>
            <li>
                ¼ teaspoon salt
            </li>
            <li>
                ½ cup butter

        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, combine flour, baking soda and salt. In a separate bowl, cream together butter and brown sugar. Stir in eggs and mashed bananas until well blended. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture; stir just to moisten. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in preheated oven for 60 to 65 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean. Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack.
